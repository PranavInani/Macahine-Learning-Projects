# Image Quantization with K-Means Clustering

## Introduction

In this project, we explore the principles and applications of image quantization using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Image quantization is a technique used to reduce the size and complexity of images while preserving their essential visual characteristics. By grouping similar colors together, quantization enables more efficient representation of images, leading to reduced memory usage, faster transmission, and improved processing efficiency.

Through this project, we aim to implement image quantization using the K-Means algorithm, evaluate the quality of the quantized images using quantitative metrics, visualize and analyze the quantized images and evaluation results, and demonstrate the reproducibility and scalability of the quantization process.

## Key Features

- Image quantization using the K-Means clustering algorithm
- Evaluation of quantized images using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
- Visualization and analysis of quantized images and evaluation results
- Encapsulation of the quantization process into a reusable function for experimentation

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.
3. Run the code cells or execute the script to perform image quantization and evaluation.
4. Experiment with different parameters and evaluation metrics to customize the quantization process.
