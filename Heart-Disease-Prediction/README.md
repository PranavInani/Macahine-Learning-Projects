# Heart Disease Prediction
## Overview

This repository contains code for building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health-related factors. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention of heart disease.
Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains demographic information, lifestyle factors, and medical history of individuals, along with their corresponding heart disease status (presence or absence). The dataset is available in the file heart_data.csv.
Contents

  Notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation.

  Models: This directory stores trained machine learning models, including their serialized versions for easy deployment.

  Data: This directory contains the raw and processed datasets used in the project.

  Reports: This directory includes reports generated from model evaluation, such as confusion matrices, classification reports, and feature importance plots.

## Usage

To run the code and reproduce the results:

  Clone this repository to your local machine.
  Install the required dependencies
  Execute the Jupyter notebooks in the Notebooks directory in sequential order.

## Results

The trained machine learning model achieves high accuracy in predicting heart disease status based on the input features. Detailed evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports, are available in the Reports directory.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques in improving the early detection and prevention of heart disease. By leveraging predictive analytics, healthcare professionals can make informed decisions and provide timely interventions to individuals at risk of cardiovascular complications.
