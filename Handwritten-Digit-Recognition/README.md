# Handwritten Digit Recognition 

This repository contains code and resources for implementing handwritten digit recognition using machine learning techniques, specifically with TensorFlow. The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. Have achieved 98.12 percentage of accuracy.

Later, I have also implemented using convolution layer, batch normalisation and dropping half layers. I got impressive 99.41% accuracy.
## Overview

Handwritten digit recognition poses unique challenges due to variations in handwriting styles and spatial orientation. Advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have enabled significant progress in this domain.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), meticulously labeled with their corresponding digit. It serves as the foundation for developing and evaluating handwritten digit recognition models.


I have shared the model if anyone wants to play with it.
