# Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow

This repository contains code and resources for implementing handwritten digit recognition using machine learning techniques, specifically with TensorFlow. The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. Have achieved 98.12 percentage of accuracy.
## Overview

Handwritten digit recognition poses unique challenges due to variations in handwriting styles and spatial orientation. Advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have enabled significant progress in this domain.
## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), meticulously labeled with their corresponding digit. It serves as the foundation for developing and evaluating handwritten digit recognition models.
Getting Started

## To get started with the project:

    Install the required dependencies (TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib).
    Clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage

    Run the notebook Handwritten Digit Recognition.ipynb to explore the implementation of handwritten digit recognition.
    Follow the step-by-step instructions to load the dataset, preprocess the data, define the model architecture, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
    Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization techniques to improve performance.
