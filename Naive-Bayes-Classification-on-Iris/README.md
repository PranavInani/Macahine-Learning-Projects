# Naive Bayes Classifier for Iris Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier for the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic benchmark dataset in machine learning, consisting of measurements of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
# Overview

In this project, we explore the application of a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.

    iris.data: CSV file containing the raw data for the Iris dataset.

Usage

To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Install numpy, pandas and sklearn if not already isntalled.
    Open the Naive_Bayes_on_iris.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    Execute the cells in the notebook to explore the dataset, train the Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluate its performance.

Results

The Naive Bayes classifier achieved varying accuracy scores on the testing set, ranging from 0.9777 to 1.0. This variability highlights the sensitivity of the model's performance to changes in the random seed parameter during data splitting.
